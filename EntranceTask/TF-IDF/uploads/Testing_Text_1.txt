Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. 
Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to 
find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed. The iterative aspect of machine 
learning is important because as models are exposed to new data, they are able to adapt independently.
