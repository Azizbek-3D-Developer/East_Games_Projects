# LestaGames Entrance Task

This repository contains the solution to the **entrance task** provided by **Lesta Games**. The task involves building a web application that processes uploaded text files, calculates the **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores, and displays the top words based on these scores.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The web application is built using **FastAPI** and **Python**, with **Jinja2** for HTML rendering.

### âœ… Features

- **User Registration** â€“ Create a new user account.
- **User Login** â€“ Authenticate and receive a JWT token (valid for 1 hour).
- **File Upload** â€“ Upload `.txt` files for processing.
- **TF-IDF Calculation** â€“ Compute the TF-IDF scores of words using `scikit-learn`.
- **Top 50 Words Display** â€“ View the highest-ranked words based on TF-IDF scores.
- **Result Page** â€“ Visual presentation of word statistics and scores.
- **Dark Theme** â€“ Modern, user-friendly dark UI.
- **Collections Support** â€“ Users can create collections and assign documents to them.

### ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **FastAPI** â€“ High-performance Python web framework.
- **scikit-learn** â€“ For computing TF-IDF scores.
- **Jinja2** â€“ Template engine for rendering HTML.
- **python-dotenv** â€“ Manage environment variables.
- **CSS** â€“ Custom styling for frontend UI.

### ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Upload** â€“ Users upload a `.txt` file using a web form.
2. **Processing** â€“ Server extracts content and computes TF-IDF scores using `TfidfVectorizer`.
3. **Display** â€“ Results are shown on a dedicated results page, highlighting the top N words.
4. **Monitoring** â€“ Endpoints provide application health status, version info, and performance metrics.
